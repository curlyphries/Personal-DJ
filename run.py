"""
Entry-point for the local AI-DJ MVP.

This script can launch the application in either GUI or CLI mode.

Flow:
1. Ask user for a vibe / command.
2. DJAgent generates commentary + track choice.
3. VoiceAgent converts commentary to speech.
4. MusicAgent plays commentary audio, then the chosen song.
